kidney development, nephron formation
stem cells on the outside, develop inward
relatively well-known development tree, 5 lineages
collecting duct, interstitium, vasculature

sent paired samples to seqFISH (spatial genomics), Xenium
Xenium failed
227 genes
two timepoints: wk 13, 16.5
clustered together, seems to work for identification

there's a Seurat function for "mapping RNAseq to spatial data"
Gage Crump's lab used it

Kidney Cell Explorer is a similar project
Human Nephrogenesis Atlas another

baseMEMOIR (prev: intMEMOIR) system for tracking lineages in cells
