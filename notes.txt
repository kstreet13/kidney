Nils Lindstrom, Connor

kidney development, nephron formation
stem cells on the outside, develop inward
relatively well-known development tree, 5 lineages
collecting duct, interstitium, vasculature

sent paired samples to seqFISH (spatial genomics), Xenium
Xenium failed
227 genes
two timepoints: wk 13, 16.5
clustered together, seems to work for identification

there's a Seurat function for "mapping RNAseq to spatial data"
Gage Crump's lab used it

Kidney Cell Explorer is a similar project
Human Nephrogenesis Atlas another

baseMEMOIR (prev: intMEMOIR) system for tracking lineages in cells

----------
Nils has been comparing Spatial Genomics to Xenium
SG has higher resolution, more dynamic range
Kidney has nice, cleanly separated structures that can be used to double check imputed values
*** Check imputed vs. actual values
Next step will be ligand-receptor interaction analysis (notch, FGF)

need to reduce number of genes to be predicted
include: 
 - 2000 most variable, 
 - ~250 from spatial, 
 - TFs from paper
 - L-R pair genes from CellChat
paper: "Comparative single-cell analyses identify shared and divergent features of human and mouse kidney development" has links to two lists of TFs, refs 116 (mouse) and 117 (human, George Church) 
~1500 genes each
Human paper: A comprehensive library of human transcription factors for cell fate engineering. Nat. Biotechnol.
CellChat has list of L-R pairs that should also be included
WNT11, WNT9B, WNT4; latter two are interesting L-R pair
HNF4A+, JAG1+, FGF8-, BMP7, BMP4+

----------
WNT signaling creates polarity, asymmetry -> nephron formation
podocytes express NPHS2 very distinctly and PTPRO or PTPRQ
why are we so bad at predicting expression?
