----------
Nils Lindstrom, Connor

kidney development, nephron formation
stem cells on the outside, develop inward
relatively well-known development tree, 5 lineages
collecting duct, interstitium, vasculature

sent paired samples to seqFISH (spatial genomics), Xenium
Xenium failed
227 genes
two timepoints: wk 13, 16.5
clustered together, seems to work for identification

there's a Seurat function for "mapping RNAseq to spatial data"
Gage Crump's lab used it

Kidney Cell Explorer is a similar project
Human Nephrogenesis Atlas another

baseMEMOIR (prev: intMEMOIR) system for tracking lineages in cells

----------
Nils has been comparing Spatial Genomics to Xenium
SG has higher resolution, more dynamic range
Kidney has nice, cleanly separated structures that can be used to double check imputed values
*** Check imputed vs. actual values
Next step will be ligand-receptor interaction analysis (notch, FGF)
