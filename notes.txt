Nils Lindstrom, Connor

kidney development, nephron formation
stem cells on the outside, develop inward
relatively well-known development tree, 5 lineages
collecting duct, interstitium, vasculature

sent paired samples to seqFISH (spatial genomics), Xenium
Xenium failed
227 genes
two timepoints: wk 13, 16.5
clustered together, seems to work for identification

there's a Seurat function for "mapping RNAseq to spatial data"
Gage Crump's lab used it

Kidney Cell Explorer is a similar project
Human Nephrogenesis Atlas another

baseMEMOIR (prev: intMEMOIR) system for tracking lineages in cells


2024-08-01
----------
Nils has been comparing Spatial Genomics to Xenium
SG has higher resolution, more dynamic range
Kidney has nice, cleanly separated structures that can be used to double check imputed values
*** Check imputed vs. actual values
Next step will be ligand-receptor interaction analysis (notch, FGF)

need to reduce number of genes to be predicted
include: 
 - 2000 most variable, 
 - ~250 from spatial, 
 - TFs from paper
 - L-R pair genes from CellChat
paper: "Comparative single-cell analyses identify shared and divergent features of human and mouse kidney development" has links to two lists of TFs, refs 116 (mouse) and 117 (human, George Church) 
~1500 genes each
Human paper: A comprehensive library of human transcription factors for cell fate engineering. Nat. Biotechnol.
CellChat has list of L-R pairs that should also be included
WNT11, WNT9B, WNT4; latter two are interesting L-R pair
HNF4A+, JAG1+, FGF8-, BMP7, BMP4+



2024-08-26
----------
WNT signaling creates polarity, asymmetry -> nephron formation
podocytes express NPHS2 very distinctly and PTPRO or PTPRQ
why are we so bad at predicting expression?

They will send:
 - new multi-ome Suerat object (snRNAseq, scATACseq, long RNA seq for isoforms)
 - coordinates of two well-understood gene profiles
 - informative genes
I send them:
 - stabmap integration for RNA+ROI1+ROI2

----------
Andrew, Connor
Andrew running SC3, taking time
talking about transferring pseudotime/labels
Andrew suggested Seurat CCA for integration (replacing StabMap)
Could also run Slingshot in integrated space and then project spatial cells (instead of imputing by KNN)


2024-10-22
----------
Andrew, Connor, Michael
integration was done across samples
Andrew re-ran analysis on subset (remove low-quality and cells not on main trajectory) using SCT and no integration
probably don't need integration
CITED1 and SIX1 mark progenitors
Michael will take over analysis from Andrew
go back to full data, check for doublets, remove them from Andrew's subset
run Totem/Slingshot on subset
map to spatial



2024-10-29
----------
Connor, Michael
Connor: intro to kidney development, script for visualizing marker genes from Seurat object
Michael will run scDblFinder on full data, visualize on Andrew's subset

Connor, Lola
Connor will look at spatial integration data, get it ready for next rotation

Connor, Lola, Victor
Overview of plan for mapping pseudotime onto spatial
Victor has run stabmap

figure 1:
overview
spatial transcriptomics + scMultiome UMAP
figure 2:
cell types in space
macro
overall spatial expression patterns
different stages of development
5 super clear genes
5 clear imputed genes
figure 3:
developmental trajectories in multiome and spatial
3 or 4:
incorporate ATAC
peak accessibility as function of PT
Want to go back and re-run trajectory inference with combined RNA and ATAC


2025-08-20
----------
got good reviews for manuscript
explicitly asked for mapping single-cell onto spatial
Nils: the message is about ligand/receptors
reviewers: what's the receptor for WNT[X]?
want to look for WNT/receptor co-localization
have CellChat results (cell type A talks to cell type B)
if we had clustering on spatial data, could look at co-localization of those clusters
Connor has new snRNAseq dataset, grabbed cells that match spatial, we also have the small scRNAseq already in the paper
do the analysis in two streams, take whichever looks better
hope to use the smaller dataset already in paper
I just have to do the co-embedding (stabmap), they'll do manual annotation
Connor will send link to files
